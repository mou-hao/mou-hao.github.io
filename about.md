Hi! I'm Hao, a software developer. Welcome to my blog! 

Born and raised in Shanghai, I went to Chicago in 2015 and got my Bachelor's 
degree from the University of Chicago in 2018. 
After college, I came back to Shanghai and have since been living and working
here. 

I am now doing a Master's program offered by UIUC and am expected to graduate
in Spring 2023. 
I am still working full-time, and I currently work for Morgan Stanley.
