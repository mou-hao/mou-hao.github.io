Just got this blog working. 
It is a Jekyll-based site hosted on GitHub, and the theme is a customized 
version of [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/). 
I really like the small icons for social media accounts in the default 
[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/) theme, so I spent some time 
adding those into the footer. 

花了点时间在GitHub上用Jekyll建了个个人博客。以后可能时不时会更新，还请多多关照！
