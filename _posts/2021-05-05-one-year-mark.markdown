It has been a year since I started this blog. The past year has been an extremely
difficult one for a lot of people. Some lost their livelihood. Some lost their
loved ones. Although some of us are more fortunate, we all lost something because
of the pandemic.

At the same time, I am pretty sure many of us also learned something from this 
sadness. We learned to cherish, to appreciate, and to be grateful. We learned how
to live our lives largely isolated. We learned to adapt.

I have been mostly working from home since the start of the pandemic, and the 
experience has been overall positive. I had to buy a new monitor, as the paltry 
screen real estate a laptop can offer is just not enough for work, but the new 
arrangement saves me 2-3 hours of commute time per day.

I started pursuing new hobbies: learning Cantonese and pencil drawing, but 
neither lasted long. I also started thinking about doing an online Master's
degree, which miraculously came into fruition: I applied to UIUC's online MCS
and got accepted, and my first semester began this January.

I am only taking one course (Computational Photography) in the first semester,
and am having quite some fun playing with images. I will share some results from
the course projects in future posts. Highly recommended to any fellow UIUC OMCS
student, especially if you want to know how photoshopping actually works.

In the coming year, I will use this blog more, mainly to share my experience from
UIUC OMCS, but I will post other stuff as well.

Lastly, stay healthy and stay safe. Peace.
