It has been a year since I started this blog.

The past year has been a strange one because of the pandemic.
I stayed mostly isolated by myself from the start of 2020 to Summer of the same
year.
In May, the situation where I live was fornunately mostly under control, and I
could go outside and meet my friends again.
I have also been working from home for the most of the year.

I am a bit surprised by how well the WFH arrangement worked out.
Even though I could not meet my colleagues in person, all still went quite
smoothly.
Plus this saved me 2-3 hours of commute time each day.

This allowed me to pursue some new hobbies: I started learning Cantonese and
pencil drawing, but sadly neither lasted too long.
I also started thinking about doing an online Master's degree.
I actually had thought about this a couple of times before the pandemic,
but thanks to this new abundance of free time, I could really think seriously
and weigh the pros and cons.
The result of this deliberation was that academic curiosity and the desire to
put more nice things on my resume won out, and I applied to UIUC's online MCS
and got accepted.
My first semester just began this January.

I am only taking one course (Computational Photography) in the first semester
and am having quite some fun playing with images.
I will share some results from the course projects in future posts.
Highly recommended to any fellow UIUC OMCS student, especially if you are into
photo-editing or computer vision.

In the coming year, I will use this blog more, mainly to share my experience
from UIUC OMCS, but I will post other stuff as well.

Stay safe. Peace.
