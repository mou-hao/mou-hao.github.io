You can now search by clicking the search icon on the navigation bar! 
I implemented the search functionality using Lunr. 
You can find a guide here: [Jekyll search using lunr.js](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/).

I also spent some time customizing the search page and the search box css so that 
it will appear once you click the search icon, and disappear when out of focus.
You can find the css [here](https://github.com/mou-hao/mou-hao.github.io/blob/master/_includes/navigation.html).
